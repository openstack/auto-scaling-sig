Use cases
=========

The Auto-Scaling SIG intends to gather user cases for many different
auto-scaling scenarios in OpenStack.  Not all use cases will be
immediately available, and some may never be implemented. But
collecting all the possible use cases will help in communication and
build a view of what is possible.

Compute resource scaling

   use-cases/*

Control plane scaling
---------------------

While the possibility of scaling the Control Plane was discussed at the Denver PTG,
there are currently no defined use cases or requirements.  Contributions are welcome.


Other scaling
-------------

Similar to Control Plane Scaling, there may be other categories of scaling which
could be handled by an Orchestration Engine but have yet to be defined.

History
-------

An initial list of use cases was captured at the Denver 2019 PTG
https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/DEN-auto-scaling-SIG

How to submit a new use case
----------------------------

When submitting a new use case, please use ``use-cases/template.rst``
as a starting point.
